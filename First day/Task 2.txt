class Demo {

    final int MAX_VALUE = 99;

    void myMethod() {
        MAX_VALUE = 101;
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Demo obj = new Demo();
        obj.myMethod();
    }
}

\\ the error is that we can't change the vale of "MAX_VALUE" because it is final ,we can solve the error in two ways, the frist way is to remove "final"
\\ the other way to fix the error is to create a new local variable in the method "myMethod" with a differnet name and keep the variable "MAX_VALUe" final
